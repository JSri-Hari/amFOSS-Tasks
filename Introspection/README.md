# INTROSPECTION
### Why must we choose you?
I started studying JAVA programming in class 10th and enjoyed the time by analyzing complex coding. I learned some loops and almost revised the Computer Applications subject twice that year. That year I concluded to include coding field in my career. I really like to explore more in this coding field and grow my skills. I am really may be lazy in work but not when it comes to coding and digital technology.
### What is your plan for the next 6 months?
I really want improve in this field and if got selected for amFOSS I can progress at high rate. And also as my academic classes started late this year I want complete them as fast as I can. My parents really expect a good result. This is my plan for next 6 months.
## How would you contribute back to the club?
I will try to work to the extent of my limits to do what the club wants from me. I would give my best to achieve something in future which 
amfoss could feel proud of me.
## Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
I think this selection process is the best i have ever seen. This selection process gives a great learning experience to whosoever who attempt the 
tasks.I was amazed to see what my progress was because of these tasks in one month so i personally find the selection process very ethical.
