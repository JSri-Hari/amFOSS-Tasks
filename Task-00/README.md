## Install Ubuntu 22.04.1[Desktop]
This task is easy but not for me even though I am using i5 core processor laptop because my laptop is encrypted with Bitlocker security and all.
The worst thing is even though I know thw password I cannot turnoff the security and whenever I try to install it just declines. So I separately 
created space for the Ubuntu OS in mthe drive and installed it in my laptop. The good thing is I learned something in my laptop for my future 
refernce work. I may need to install many OS like this manner. But atlast I can say when i completed the installation and looked back at the 
process I have done, its fun. I installed this OS Ubuntu by watching a youtube video.
